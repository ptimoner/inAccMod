)
}
\arguments{
\item{mainPath}{character; the parent directory of the location folder}

\item{location}{character; the location folder name}

\item{alwaysDownload}{logical; should the raster always be downloaded, even if it has already been 
downloaded? If FALSE and if the raster has already been downloaded the user is 
interactively asked whether they want to download it again or not.}

\item{mostRecent}{logical; should the most recent boundary shapefile be selected to define the required landcover tiles? 
If FALSE and if there are multiple available inputs, the user is interactively asked to select the input based on file creation

The function downloads the landcover tiles from the AWS cloud and determines the file names based on the extent
of the boundary shapefile. If there are multiple tiles, it produces a mosaic.
