\usage{
download_osm(
  mainPath,
  location,
  type,
  alwaysDownload = FALSE,
  mostRecent = TRUE,
  defaultClasses = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mainPath}{character; the parent directory of the location folder}

\item{location}{character; the location folder name}

\item{type}{character; target layer. Can be 'roads', 'waterLines' or 'waterPolygons'}

\item{alwaysDownload}{logical; should the shapefile always be downloaded, even if it has already been 
downloaded? If FALSE and if the shapefile has already been downloaded the user is 
interactively asked whether they want to download it again or not.}

\item{mostRecent}{logical; should the most recent boundary shapefile be selected? If FALSE and if there are multiple
available inputs, the user is interactively asked to select the input based on file creation time.}

\item{defaultClasses}{logical; should only the default classes be kept? If not, the user is interactively asked to select the categories
they want to keep. For 'roads', default classes are: trunk, trunk_link, primary, primary_link, 
motorway, motorway_link, secondary, secondary_link, tertiary, tertiary_link, road, raceway, residential,
