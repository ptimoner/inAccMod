\usage{
initiate_project(
  mainPath,
  allowInteractivity = TRUE,
  city = FALSE,
  name = NULL,
  iso = NULL,
  testMode = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mainPath}{character; a path where the country/city folder will be created}

\item{allowInteractivity}{logical; whether to enable interactivity. \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{city}{logical; whether to focus on cities instead of countries. \code{FALSE} by default.}

\item{name}{character; country or city name required when \code{allowInteractivity} is set to \code{FALSE}. Must match perfectly either one of 
the names included in inAccessMod::country_list (country) or inAccessMod::city_list (city). For cities, can also be the name 
of the city combined with the country ISO2 code when > 1 city have the same name (ex. 'Vancouver'). In this case the format 
is the following: city name, white space, hyphen, space, code (ex. 'Zurich - CH'). This parameter is ignored when \code{allowInteractivity} 
is set to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{iso}{character; optional and only when city is TRUE, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code.
The ESRI World Urban Areas dataset may have inaccurate country information for cities situated near borders, and this parameter allows the user
to set up the country in which is located the city. Using an incorrect code for downloading the population raster 
can result in either an issue or obtaining the wrong population dataset.}

\item{testMode}{logical; \code{FALSE} by default. Can be ignored. used for testing the function in the testthat context.}
}
\description{
Select the country or city, get the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code, store it in a config.txt file and create the directory 
main structure for the project. This function also creates a log.txt file that will record and track the main operations 
related to the project.
}
\details{
The final structure arises when downloading and processing the data with the corresponding functions,
and it allows multiple 'raw' inputs and multiple 'processed' outputs for each input. This can be useful when 
performing different analyses for the same country (e.g. when we have updated data).

# Replace workDir with the actual path to your working directory
